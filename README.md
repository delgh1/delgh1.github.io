# About

## Self introduction taken from /about

My name is Jing Luo. I'm fluent in Chinese (Mandarin), English, and Japanese. In my free time, I work on free software projects and promote free software, free culture, and the democratization of technology.

My roles in the GNU project: gnu.org Chinese & Japanese translation team member (2023-08~). GNU webmaster (2023-10~).

I grant myself the rank of webmaster, postmaster, and hostmaster.

## My Personal Website

This's my tech blog, a website built from Jekyll. Do you need more explanation? Really?
