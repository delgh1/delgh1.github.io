title: "I fired my therapy dog"
---

```
I fired my therapy dog
Looking at me he is not
Playing with the toy I bought
Sleeping like a silent rock

I fired my therapy dog
Forever I am lost
I failed to feed him food
He was unable to calm my mood

I fired my therapy dog
"Stop licking my sock"
To him I've always been true
Left me with his baby tooth

I can no longer exploit my dog
For he's more depressed than me now
How can I ever go to sleep
Never want him to leave
That's when I realize
I never had a dog
```
